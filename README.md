# Welcome
I'm at that point in my life where I need to calculate, estimate, and predict my GPA every term (and potentially my CGPA to see if I'm still in a good standing lmao). 

# Accessing
## Access via Heroku
**Working website as of 2022/07/29:** `gpacalcph.herokuapp.com/`

## Access via localhost
1. Git clone the repo via SSH, HTTPS, or your preferred option
2. Make sure to run the command line in the exact location of `
university-gpa-calculator `
3. Run the cmd command: `npm install`
4. Once command successfully finishes, run the cmd command `npm start` like any normal React app

# Things to know
The current calculation for the GPA and CGPA is based off of the DLSU 2021 Handbook. Future goals include getting information for other universities as well

# Motivation for creation
Why create a complicated and clunky ***Excel sheet*** when you can create a complicated and clunky ***website*** instead? 

So instead of manually creating something that takes about an hour, automate the process by creating something that takes about three weeks!
