# Welcome!
I'm at that point in my life where I need to calculate, estimate, and predict my GPA every term (and potentially my CGPA to see if I'm still in a good standing). Why create a complicated and clunky Excel sheet when you can create a complicated and clunky website instead that works for my preferences and automates the issues I experienced, amirite?
