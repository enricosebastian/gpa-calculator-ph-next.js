# Formulas
Formulas are essentially imitating the strategy pattern of sorts: "*composition over inheritance*". I just thought—for future purposes—there might be future "formulas" that other universities use that I could integrate into my code...if I had time or was bored

The idea is we have one Calculator class, where we can inject formula interface types. The formula interface is inherited by solid formulas in return
